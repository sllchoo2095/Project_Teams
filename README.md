# Project_Teams
A Java project which sorts students into teams for their final year industry projects. 


If you want to run console functionality, please run the TeamProjectMain from the model class. 
If running from command line use ``javac TeamProjectMain.java``
If you run the user input you must use the options in order,skipping number 4
If you want to automatically upload some data click ``4``. But that will not assign the teams. 

If you want to run the GUI it relies on it being prepopulated from data from ``serialiased_data.ser`` Run from application package Main. 

Also the automated team assignment algorithm will rely on the use of the console in TeamProjectMain. 

Reports are both in PDF and the text file version are in the reports package.
